## Description
  - As a kid, I always had a passion to learn about the Universe. That passion continued into adulthood! I know am looking to build a website to show others why the Universe is a topic that everyone should get excited about! 
  - This website will have a home page with a carousel of photos from NASA's photo of the day API, as well as several categories providing information on various categories.
  - The website will break down into 3 subtopics: our solar system, the universe, & cosmic wonders. Each of those subtopics will then have several items in them that will contain information and photos about the topic at hand.
