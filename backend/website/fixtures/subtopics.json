Our Sun is a medium-sized star located about 93 million miles away from us. It is by far the largest object in our solar system, yet it is actually rather tiny compared to other stars. The Pistol Star located 26 thousand light years away is 100 times more massive than our Sun. However, our Sun is the perfect size for us. If it was as big as the Pistol Star, then no life would be able to survive on Earth. The same thing would happen if the Sun was half the size it is now.\nEven though the Sun is only a medium-sized star, its gravitational pull is strong enough to have an effect on celestial objects 9 trillion miles away! The surface of the Sun is not solid and is made up of super-hot electrically charged gas called plasma. At the core, temperatures reach upwards of 27 million degrees Fahrenheit - hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. If you would like to learn more, please check out the additional resources!",

Crazy enough the Alpha Centauri system is actually home to three stars: Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us, but it is difficult to see because of how tiny it is. Proxima Centauri is about 1/10 the mass of the Sun, while the Alpha Centauri stars are around the same size as the Sun. The Alpha Centauri stars are relatively close. They are about 4 billion miles apart, which is almost equal to the distance from the Sun to Pluto. However, Proxima Centauri is about 1.2 trillion miles away from them; but, since the Alpha Centauri pair are close together their combined gravity keeps Proxima Centauri orbiting around them. The Alpha Centauri stars orbit about a common center of mass every 80 years and Proxima Centauri orbits around them every 550,000 years.\nIn the past decade, astronomers have been searching for planets around the Alpha Centauri system. Since they are the closest star system to us, the odds of finding planets are higher. Astronomers have been successful in finding 2 planets so far. The first one was discovered near Proxima Centauri in the star's habitable zone. Astronomers believe that there could be liquid water on the planet. The second planet is also new Proxima Centauri and located in the star's habitable zone. The two planets orbit rather closely to their star, but since the star is much smaller and cooler than our Sun, they are still in the habitable zone. This is very exciting news as these planets might be our new homes in the distant future! Please check out the resources below to learn more.",

      "article": "Approximately 13.7 billion years ago, our Universe burst onto the scene with a bang! Starting out as an infinitely hot and dense single point, the Universe stretched and inflated at unimaginable speeds. The early universe was also insanely hot. Scientists say that it was about 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the insane heat, particles, atoms, and all the ingredients that would become stars and galaxies flooded the Universe.\nTime marched on and the Universe would cool. As it cooled, it would eventually reach the temperature where electrons combine with nuclei to form neutral atoms. Before this \"recombination\" occurred, the Universe would have been opaque because the free electrons would have caused light (photons) to scatter the way sunlight scatters from water droplets in clouds. But when the free electrons were absorbed to form neutral atoms, the Universe suddenly became transparent. Those same photons - the afterglow of the Big Bang known as cosmic microwave background - can be observed today.\nNASA has been focused on studying the cosmic microwave background by taking pictures of the Universe when it was only 400,000 years old. The first mission focused on the cosmic microwave background was in 1992. This was when the Cosmic Background Explorer team mapped the primordial hot and cold spots in the cosmic microwave background. 2 other missions have been launched since then to continue mapping the cosmic microwave background.

      "article": "The universe, like all things, will eventually come to an end. It will happen long after we are gone and by then the human population will most likely have died off, along with our Sun and the rest of life on Earth. Astronomers have so far come up with 3 possibilities for how the Universe will end: the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, and the Big Crunch.\nThe Big Freeze is the first possible death we will cover. Astronomers found that after decades of research the Universe will most likely face this long, drawn-out death also known as a \"heat death\". Within a couple trillion years, the Universe will have expanded so far that no distant galaxies will be visible from our own. In 100 trillion years, all the stars in the universe will have burned out and ceased to exist. Then, last but not least, the black holes will be the last surviving relics of our Universe; but, they too will cease to exist after an enormous amount of time. This leaves us with an empty, cold, desolate universe with nothing to brighten our day. Unfortunately, this is the most likely course of action, but luckily we won't be around to have to see it.\nA far more exciting way for the universe to end would be the Big Rip! This is our second possible death and focuses on dark energy and the hypothesis that the universe will continue to accelerate its expansion soon reaching infinity which will cause cataclysmic results. This idea was first hypothesized in 2003 and has gained more support in recent years thanks to new evidence. The Big Rip centers around dark energy, which makes up 70% of all matter in the universe. Some astronomers and astrophysicists think that in the distant future dark energy will get stronger the further the universe expands and eventually tear everything apart. What a way to go! However, current estimates say this could not happen for another 22 billion years, so we are safe for now!\nThe last possible cause of death that we will cover is the Big Crunch and it is the most exciting one of all! Astronomers theorize that the Big Crunch will happen due to the universe's expansion coming to a standstill. Then, as gravity pulls on the matter, the universe will begin to contract, falling inward until it has collapsed back into a super-hot, super-dense singularity. If the theory holds true, the universe is like a giant soufflé. It starts out small, then expands as it heats up. Eventually, however, the soufflé cools and begins to collapse. The craziest part of this idea though is that astronomers think that if the universe converts back into a super-hot, super-dense singularity just like how the universe started with the Big Bang. Then, another Big Bang could happen and the universe could restart all over again! All of the above possibilities of the universe's death are quite interesting and if you would like to learn more, check out the resources below!",

They are places in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, which is why they are invisible to us. Space telescopes can detect them thanks to special instruments. Black holes can be extremely large or very small. Scientists think that the smallest black holes are the size of a single atom, yet have the mass of a large mountain. On the other end of the scale, black holes can reach sizes more than a billion times more massive than our Sun. These black holes are called supermassive black holes and scientists think that one exists at the center of every galaxy causing the galaxy to spin.\nFirst predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, black holes are formed when a massive star dies. After a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core. If the core's mass is more than three times the mass of the Sun, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole. The nearest black hole to Earth is Gaia BH1, which is only 1,566 light-years away! If you're interested in learning more, please check out our resources.",

They are often found in the space between stars and can take several different forms including emission nebula, reflection nebula, planetary nebula, supernova remnant, & dark nebula.\nNebulas are key to the lifecycle of stars. In these vast clouds, gas, dust, and other material become dense clumps due to gravity. These clouds are made up of mostly hydrogen, which when put under intense pressure ignites these dense clumps and turns them into stars. At the end of a star's life, it turns into a white dwarf; but during this process, they release clouds of gas which form a so-called \"planetary nebula\".\nIn order to capture these glorious creations, telescopes have to use the infrared radiation emitted by nebulas to create an image. You're probably wondering why this is necessary. Well, due to the dense amount of gas & dust, visible light from stars in a nebula cannot escape. This requires scientists to look at other light wavelengths emitted from nebulas, such as infrared light. To learn more about nebulas, check out the resources.",

These explosions are called supernovas and they occur every 10 seconds throughout the Universe. A supernova occurs when one of 2 things happens. First, if a star steals matter from another star until it accumulates too much matter, it will explode, resulting in a supernova. The other way a supernova can occur is at the end of a massive star's life. As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core. Eventually, the core is so heavy that it cannot withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, which results in the giant explosion of a supernova.\nScientists have determined that supernovas play a key role in distributing elements throughout the universe. When a star explodes, it shoots elements and debris into space. Many of the elements we find here on Earth are made in the core of stars. These elements travel on to form new stars, planets, and everything else in the universe. This means that the elements that make up our very own bodies came from stars that exploded hundreds of millions of years ago!

NASA's Messenger spacecraft conducted a mission, where it mapped the surface of Mercury. Messenger is the second of 2 NASA spacecraft to ever go to Mercury.\nEven on the smallest planet, crazy events can take place. Scientists have been perplexed by Mercury's magnetic field; the planet is supposed to be too small to have a global magnetic field, yet it has a magnetic field that is only 1% the strength of the Earth's. However, according to NASA, when Mercury's magnetic field interacts with the solar wind, it sometimes generates magnetic tornadoes that channel fast, hot solar wind plasma to the surface of the itty-bitty planet. When solar wind plasma hits the surface, it displaces neutrally charged atoms on the surface, sending the loops high into Mercury's atmosphere. Want to learn more about Mercury?
