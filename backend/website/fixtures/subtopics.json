Our Sun is a medium-sized star located about 93 million miles away from us. It is by far the largest object in our solar system, yet it is actually rather tiny compared to other stars. The Pistol Star located 26 thousand light years away is 100 times more massive than our Sun. However, our Sun is the perfect size for us. If it was as big as the Pistol Star, then no life would be able to survive on Earth. The same thing would happen if the Sun was half the size it is now.\nEven though the Sun is only a medium-sized star, its gravitational pull is strong enough to have an effect on celestial objects 9 trillion miles away! The surface of the Sun is not solid and is made up of super-hot electrically charged gas called plasma. At the core, temperatures reach upwards of 27 million degrees Fahrenheit - hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. If you would like to learn more, please check out the additional resources!",

      "article": "Approximately 13.7 billion years ago, our Universe burst onto the scene with a bang! Starting out as an infinitely hot and dense single point, the Universe stretched and inflated at unimaginable speeds. The early universe was also insanely hot. Scientists say that it was about 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the insane heat, particles, atoms, and all the ingredients that would become stars and galaxies flooded the Universe.\nTime marched on and the Universe would cool. As it cooled, it would eventually reach the temperature where electrons combine with nuclei to form neutral atoms. Before this \"recombination\" occurred, the Universe would have been opaque because the free electrons would have caused light (photons) to scatter the way sunlight scatters from water droplets in clouds. But when the free electrons were absorbed to form neutral atoms, the Universe suddenly became transparent. Those same photons - the afterglow of the Big Bang known as cosmic background radiation - can be observed today.\nNASA has been focused on studying the cosmic background radiation by taking pictures of the Universe when it was only 400,000 years old. The first mission focused on the cosmic background radiation was in 1992. This was when the Cosmic Background Explorer team mapped the primordial hot and cold spots in the cosmic background radiation. 2 other missions have been launched since then to continue mapping the cosmic background radiation.

      "article": "One of the most popular topics in astronomy is black holes. They are places in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, which is why they are invisible to us. Space telescopes can detect them thanks to special instruments. Black holes can be extremely large or very small. Scientists think that the smallest black holes are the size of a single atom, yet have the mass of a large mountain. On the other end of the scale, black holes can reach sizes more than a billion times more massive than our Sun. These black holes are called supermassive black holes and scientists think that one exists at the center of every galaxy causing the galaxy to spin.\nFirst predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, black holes are formed when a massive star dies. After a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core. If the core's mass is more than three times the mass of the Sun, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole. The nearest black hole to Earth is Gaia BH1, which is only 1,566 light-years away! If you're interested in learning more, please check out our resources.",

      "article": "To me, nebulas are the most beautiful objects in the night sky. Nebulas, nebula meaning cloud in Latin, are star nurseries, enormous clouds of gas and dust light-years across. They are often found in the space between stars and can take several different forms including emission nebula, reflection nebula, planetary nebula, supernova remnant, & dark nebula.\nNebulas are key to the lifecycle of stars. In these vast clouds, gas, dust, and other material become dense clumps due to gravity. These clouds are made up of mostly hydrogen, which when put under intense pressure ignites these dense clumps and turns them into stars. At the end of a star's life, it turns into a white dwarf; but during this process, they release clouds of gas which form a so-called \"planetary nebula\".\nIn order to capture these glorious creations, telescopes have to use the infrared radiation emitted by nebulas to create an image. You're probably wondering why this is necessary. Well, due to the dense amount of gas & dust, visible light from stars in a nebula cannot escape. This requires scientists to look at other light wavelengths emitted from nebulas, such as infrared light. To learn more about nebulas, check out the resources.",

      "article": "Imagine an explosion that gives off more energy in one moment than the Sun gives off in its entire 10 billion-year lifetime. These explosions are called supernovas and they occur every 10 seconds throughout the Universe. A supernova occurs when one of 2 things happens. First, if a star steals matter from another star until it accumulates too much matter, it will explode, resulting in a supernova. The other way a supernova can occur is at the end of a massive star's life. As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core. Eventually, the core is so heavy that it cannot withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, which results in the giant explosion of a supernova.\nScientists have determined that supernovas play a key role in distributing elements throughout the universe. When a star explodes, it shoots elements and debris into space. Many of the elements we find here on Earth are made in the core of stars. These elements travel on to form new stars, planets, and everything else in the universe. This means that the elements that make up our very own bodies came from stars that exploded hundreds of millions of years ago!

Mercury is also the smallest planet in the Solar System. With a circumference of only 9,525 miles, 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth. However, Mercury is the fastest planet. Traveling at 29 miles per second, Mercury orbits around the Sun every 88 Earth days. It also had a recent visitor. NASA's Messenger spacecraft conducted a mission, where it mapped the surface of Mercury. Messenger is the second of 2 NASA spacecraft to ever go to Mercury.\nEven on the smallest planet, crazy events can take place. Scientists have been perplexed by Mercury's magnetic field; the planet is supposed to be too small to have a global magnetic field, yet it has a magnetic field that is only 1% the strength of the Earth's. However, according to NASA, when Mercury's magnetic field interacts with the solar wind, it sometimes generates magnetic tornadoes that channel fast, hot solar wind plasma to the surface of the itty-bitty planet. When solar wind plasma hits the surface, it displaces neutrally charged atoms on the surface, sending the loops high into Mercury's atmosphere. Want to learn more about Mercury?
